       <h2> Why Do I Love Sport ? ‚öΩ</h2>
       <p>
           Firstly, I like sport because it is a time for sharing. I think that sport teaches us a lot of values that are useful in life, such as team spirit, generosity, surpassing oneself... We can meet people who have the same passion as us. Secondly, I like to push myself and become physically stronger. I need to let off steam and I enjoy it.

           I also like to watch it on TV. I am a football fan, especially of Barcelona. I feel a lot of emotions during important games and I feel like I am part of the team.

       <h2>üéü Why Do I Love to Travel ? ‚úàüåç</h2>
        <p>
        I like to travel, and I would like to visit as many countries as possible. My passion for travelling probably comes from my curiosity. The first reason for my passion for travelling is that I like to discover new cultures. I think it gives you an extra knowledge and an open mind. Furthermore, I like to discover new landscapes because I find them beautiful. I need to change my horizons from time to time, it allows me to be really fulfilled.

       <h2>What about culture (books, movies, anime, series)? üé¨</h2>
        <p>
        I love to learn new things and this can be done through books and films. That's why I consume so much of it. I think you can learn a lot about the countries of the world, the ways of thinking. But the main reason why I love these things is because they entertain me a lot. Indeed, I take a lot of pleasure, I laugh, and sometimes I can even let out a tear in front of a sad scenario.
